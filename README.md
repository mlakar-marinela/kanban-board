This project represents a kanban board app with 3 sections: TO DO, IN PROGRESS and DONE.

The app was made with:

- HTML
  
- CSS
  
- REACT
  
- VITE
  
Key functionalities:

- list item creation. Each list (TO DO, IN PROGRESS, DONE) includes a button that allows users to create new list items with a single click, simplifying task input and organization.
  
- inline content editing. Users can edit the text of any list item, whether pre-existing or newly created, directly within the board, providing a flexible and efficient way to update tasks.
  
- drag and drop support. Tasks can be moved freely between the three sections using a drag-and-drop interface, making it easy to reflect progress visually and interactively.
